      <h3>Matthew Marquit</h3>
      <p>Stern and sometimes blunt, it's impossible not to be grateful for all this amazing Professor has helped me with.</p>
      <p>Matthew gives sound advice and gives advice with the interest of the student in mind.</p>
      <p>I am happy to have had his help and guidance.</p>

      <h3>Alan Hromas</h3>
      <p>In my time of panic over graduating and my SIP, Alan was kind and thoughtful.</p> 
      <p>Taking time out of his busy schedule, to help me and encourage me, was more than I feel I deserved. </p>
      <p>I will never forget that when I wanted to give up, Alan was in my corner.</p>

    <div id="Wisdom" class="tabcontent">

      <h3>Jill Coddington</h3>
      <p>Although I only had her for two classes, she went above and beyond.</p>
      <p>Coding was something I dreaded, but Jill was patient. Attending multiple meetings and sharing her wisdom with me.</p>
      <p>I continue to learn more about programming with better understanding, thanks to Jill.</p>
